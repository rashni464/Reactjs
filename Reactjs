1) what is reactjs?
A)Reactjs is the JS-Ui library used to build the Ui components by the developers and used to build a user interface.It was deeveloped by facebook and released in 2013.
It allow to build the Ui by declaritely writing JS code. Js code is maintained by react. If any changes happend in the compoents reactjs will take care to rerendering and assigning.

2) WHAT IS DOM?
A) DOM stands fordocuments object model. It is a tree like structure used to represent the structure of elements presnet in the HTML document.

3) WHAT IS REACTDOM?
A)ReactDOM is used to render componets and elements in the web application. It is part of react library used to create the user interface and dynamic web applications and
reusable components that can be used in different applications.

4) Ui without Reactjs?
A)we can build Ui without reactjs but for big size applications it will be more difficulty.We need to write HTMl tags and use the js to add the event handing to wire everything up.

5) How to install Reactjs?
A) 1. Install the Nodejs first.
 2. open VSCODE in the terminal check for node and npm version. node -v and npm -v
 3.intall the react app by : npx create-react-app myfirstapp
4: Open that folder and type: npm start

6) what are components and props?
A) components are the js functions which takes props as arguments and return the JSX.

7) WHAT IS STATE?
A)A state will be the local state of the component whenever the state is changed the component will rerender the updated JSX.
Inorder to use state we have a hook called useState. 

8)What are the features of React?
A)JSX:  JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It is used with React to describe what the user interface should look like. By using JSX, 
we can write HTML structures in the same file that contains JavaScript code.

Components: Components are the building blocks of any React application, and a single app usually consists of multiple components. 
It splits the user interface into independent, reusable parts that can be processed separately.

Virtual DOM: React keeps a lightweight representation of the real DOM in the memory, and that is known as the virtual DOM. When the 
state of an object changes, virtual DOM changes only that object in the real DOM, rather than updating all the objects.

One-way data-binding: React’s one-way data binding keeps everything modular and fast. 
A unidirectional data flow means that when designing a React app, you often nest child components within parent components.

High performance: React updates only those components that have changed, rather than updating all the components at once. 
This results in much faster web applications.

9)Can web browsers read JSX directly? 
Web browsers cannot read JSX directly. This is because they are built to only read regular JS objects and JSX is not a regular 
JavaScript object.For a web browser to read a JSX file, the file needs to be transformed into a regular JavaScript object. 
For this, we use Babel

10)Why use React instead of other frameworks, like Angular?
A)Easy creation of dynamic applications: React makes it easier to create dynamic web applications because it provides less coding and
provides more functionality, whereas, with JavaScript applications, code tends to get complex very quickly.

Improved performance: React uses virtual DOM, which makes web applications perform faster. Virtual DOM compares its previous state 
and updates only those components in the real DOM, whose states have changed, rather than updating all the components — 
like conventional web applications.

Reusable components: Components are the building blocks of any React application, and a single app usually consists 
of multiple components. These components have their own logic and controls, and they can be reused through the application,
which, in turn, dramatically reduces the development time of an application.

Unidirectional data flow: React follows a unidirectional data flow. This means that when designing a React app, we often
nest child components within parent components. And since the data flows in a single direction, it becomes easier to debug 
errors and know where the problem occurs in an application at the moment.

11)What is an event in React?
A)An event is an action that a user or system may trigger, such as pressing a key, a mouse click, etc.
React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase in HTML. Exaple: onclick, onPress

12)What are synthetic events in React?
A)Synthetic events combine the response of different browser's native events into one API, 
ensuring that the events are consistent across different browsers.
The application is consistent regardless of the browser it is running in. Here, preventDefault is a synthetic event.
